                    <p class="card-text ">American novelist Louisa May Alcott was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, on November 29, 1832, and passed away in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 6, 1888. She is best known for her children's books, particularly the beloved Little Women (1868–69).
                        Louisa Alcott was the daughter of transcendentalist Bronson Alcott and lived most of her childhood in Concord and Boston, where she was exposed to the likes of Henry David Thoreau, Theodore Parker, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. For a while, she studied at her father's avant-garde Boston Temple School and afterwards at home. Writing was Louisa's first love at a young age.  Her vivid imagination frequently led her and her sisters to create elaborate plays that they would perform for their acquaintances.  In these plays, Louisa liked to play the "lurid" roles, or as she put it, "the villains, ghosts, bandits, and disdainful queens."

                    <p class="card-text"> After publishing the poem Sunlight under a pen name in 1851, Alcott proceeded to write a wide range of thrillers, poetry, potboilers, and juvenile tales. She took over as editor of Merry's Museum, a children's magazine, in 1867. Little Women was written by Alcott there at the urging of her publisher. Like her other works, the novel was mostly conceived in her head before she put pen to paper. Two periods of six weeks were used to write the entire book. When Massachusetts granted women the right to vote for school, taxes, and bonds in 1879, Alcott was the first woman to register in Concord. Eventually, she succeeded in convincing her editor to release Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement by Harriett Hanson Robinson in 1881. Jo's Boys (1886), Alcott's last book, argued for equality for women and other improvements. "I remember a time when anti-slavery sentiment was exactly as it is today, and I am more proud of the meager assistance we Alcotts could provide than of all the books I have ever written," the woman remarked.

                    <p class="card-text">Louisa May Alcott, a Pennsylvania native who wrote 270 novels for young readers, is most known for her novel Little Women. Alcott was a prolific writer of books for American girls. This charming book immortalized the goals and values of middle-class household life during that era. Ever since its initial serial publication in 1868–1870, the book has been published continually in print. Her own experiences served as a major inspiration for the widely read book. Alcott, the second of four daughters, started writing to help her family, who lived in constant poverty, at first. One important influence in her life was her mother, who was caring and strong. Alcott wrote, "I think she is a very brave, good woman" about her mother. "And I want to have a peaceful, beautiful house for her, free of worries and debts."

                    <p class="card-text">At first, Alcott wrote potboilers, and many of her stories were graphic and violent, especially those published under the pen name "A.M. Barnard." The latter pieces stand out for their strong, independent, and creative representations of women. After the American Civil War, she volunteered to work as a nurse, but due to filthy hospital conditions, she contracted typhoid and was sent home. She never fully recovered from her illness. Hospital Sketches (1863), a book compilation of her letters, gave her her first taste of notoriety.Louisa Alcott became concerned for her family's well-being when her father's utopian village he had founded failed. Alcott had recognized at an early age that her father was too unrealistic to support his wife and four kids. After working as a domestic worker, she started writing.</p>
